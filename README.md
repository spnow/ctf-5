# Security Challenges
Here lies all the cyber security challenges I have done over the years categorized by the competition. I do not have all writeups finished, but since I solve more challenges than I have writeups I try and catch up when available. Some challenges can not be reproduced based on content present on the competition's servers not handed out to the public, but I try to mimic these with running the files locally on your own machine (socat)
